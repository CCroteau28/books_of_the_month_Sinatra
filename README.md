Books Of The Month Sinatra Project

Welcome to my Books of the Month app! This is my demo app I created using Sinatra and Active Record. My Books of the Month app displays the current books of the month for June and May. It includes the books description, title, author and genre. With the choice of editing/ updating a book, as well as adding a new book. Its all user-provided and requires a username and password to sign in. If you don't have a username to sign in with you can also sign up.
